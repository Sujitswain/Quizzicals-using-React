About

Quizzical is a Trivia game implemented in ReactJS. While Creating this project I learned Event Listeners in React, React State, Conditional Rendering in React, React Hooks(useEffect), etc. A player is given 5 random questions with 4 choices are retrieved from https://opentdb.com/api_config.php (Open Trivia Database API). The player can validate their answers and play as many times as they want.
